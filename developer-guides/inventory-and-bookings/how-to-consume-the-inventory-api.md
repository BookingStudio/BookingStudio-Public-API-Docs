# How to Consume the Inventory Api

The purpose of this document is to provide high level information about how to consume the BookingStudio Inventory API. The document includes information about the terminology, the basic information about the API, and how to
consume the API along with examples and references.

The API is designed to be consumed by `Partners` that want to integrate the `Client` inventory and to make possible for the `Partner` to make bookings in the `Client` system.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information about the API, please refer to the API documentation.
> [More information here](../../README.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please refer the [terminology document](terminology.md) for a detailed explanation of the terminology used in this document.

## Basic Information About the Api

This section provides basic information about the API. It includes information about `Authentication`, the `User-Agent`,
the `Versioning`, and the `Rate Limiting`.

### Authentication

The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. You need to obtain an api key from the `Client` in order to consume the Â´Api`.
The api key is used as the username and the password are empty.

### User-Agent

You should set the `User-Agent` header to a string that identifies your application. For example:

```
User-Agent: MyApplication/1.0
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't set the `User-Agent` header, your requests will be rejected.

### Versioning

The API is versioned. The version is specified in the header of the request. It should not be confused with the version
specified in the `Uri` of the request. This refers to the version of the API itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each endpoint has its own version that should be used and provided in the header of the request.

### Rate Limiting

The API is rate limited. If you exceed the rate limit you will receive a 429 status code, and you will have to wait
before you can make another request.

> [!WARNING]
> Some `Endpoints` has a fair usage policy. This means that you are only allowed to fetch in line with the policy
> outlined in this document. This is a soft policy, and you will not be blocked if you exceed the limit, but we reserve
> the
> right to block you, **without notice**, if you exceed the limit by a large margin. This is to ensure that the system
> is
> not overloaded and for the benefit of all `Partners` and `Clients`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are being rate limited, you should implement an exponential backoff strategy. This means that you should wait
> before making another request and not make another request immediately.

use them.

```http request
GET /v1/languages.xml

    <Item/>
</Items>
```

### Fetching Lodgings

The API provides an `Endpoint` with all the `Lodgings` made available for the `Partner` by the `Client`.

#### Example Request and Response

> Use version 1 of this `Endpoint`

> [!NOTE]
> **Rate Limit** You're allowed to fetch this list once per language every night (danish time) to keep your data in

the `Partner` by the `Client`.

> [!NOTE]
> The combinations of `BookingOptions` is high and importing each and every combination is probably not the best
> strategy. We recommend that you import the most common combinations and then update the prices for the other
> combinations that are not imported.

#### Example Request and Response

> [!WARNING]
> Always use version 3 of our BookingOption. Version 1 and 2 is deprecated and will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Rate Limit** You're allowed to fetch the prices once per language and reasonable person combination every night (
> danish time) to keep your data in sync.

**Example Request**

We have a similar `Endpoint` that allows you to fetch the `BookingOptions` for a specific `Lodging`. This is useful if
you want to fetch the `BookingOptions` for a specific `Lodging` and not all `Lodgings`, for example when you are
reacting to webhooks.
The `Endpoint` is `/v1/lodgings/{lodgingid}/bookingoptions.xml`.

This example shows how to fetch the `BookingOptions` for all `Lodgings` for a specific language and duration.

```http request
GET /v1/bookingoptions.xml?lan={languageid}&adu={adults}&dur={durations}
Version: 3
```

**Example Response Body**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<BookingOptions>
    <BookingOption/>
    <BookingOption/>
</BookingOptions>
```

Each `BookingOption` includes information about the price, discount and items according to the value of the `itp`
parameter specified.

**Pagination**

The response will be paginated using the **RFC5988 convention** with the `Link` header. The `Link` header will include a
`next` link if there are more pages to fetch.

```http header
Link: <https://{apiHost}/rest/v1/bookingoptions.xml?lan=1&pos=2055489e-bd01-4ec4-9ade-a3445d65ade8> rel="next"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `LodgingId` and the `LodgingUnitTypeId` are often the same but can be different. They represent two different
> things in the system and both should be stored in your system.

**Understanding the `Status` of a `BookingOption`**

* **Booking**: The `BookingOption` is available for booking and the price is correct.
* **Probability**: The `BookingOption` can be booked but the price is **not yet available** (the price is zero), and the
  `Booking` is not guaranteed by the `Client`. This is often used for `Lodgings` that are not yet open for booking for
  the seasonal year.
* **ProbabilityAsBooking**: The `BookingOption` can be booked but the price is an indication and is subject to change.
  The `Booking` is not guaranteed by the `Client` nor is the price. This is often used for `Lodgings` that are not yet
  open for booking for the seasonal year.

> [!NOTE]
> By default the `Probability` and `ProbabilityWithPrice` are not available to the `Partner`, but only on the `Clients`
> own website.
> If you need those `BookingOptions` you need to contact the `Client` to get access to them.

`Client`.

You can easily parse each calendar and mark affected `BookingOptions` as unavailable on your side.

### Checking for Availability on Checkout

We recommend that you check for availability during checkout to make sure that the `BookingOption` is still
available and to get the correct prices for both the `Booking` and the `Items` for the specific request.

The request will return a **200 status code** if the `BookingOption` is available. Otherwise, it will return a **404
status code** meaning that the `BookingOption` is not available.

#### Example Request and Response

> [!WARNING]
> Always use version 2 of this `Endpoint`. Version 1 is deprecated and will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Rate Limit** You're allowed to check the availability every time a `BookingOption` is selected by the `Guest`. There
> is some basic rate limiting in place to prevent abuse, but under normal circumstances you should not be affected by
> this limit.

```http request

> for both mandatory `Items` and optional `Items`.

### Webhooks

If the `Client` has our `Automation Module` enabled, it's possible for them to set up a webhook that can help to keep
your data in sync with the `Client`.

We have webhooks for the following events to help you keep your data in sync:

* Availability changes
* Price changes

> [!NOTE]
> Prices can change by custom rules laid out by the `Client`. This normally happens when the date changes from today to
> tomorrow. The webhook for prices will **not** be called for these changes, but the nightly import will make sure to
> catch these changes.
