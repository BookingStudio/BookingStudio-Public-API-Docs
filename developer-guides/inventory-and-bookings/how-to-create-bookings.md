# How to Create Bookings

The purpose of this document is to provide high level information about how to create `Bookings` in the API.

The API is designed to be consumed by `Partners` that want to integrate the `Client` inventory and to make possible for the `Partner` to make bookings in the `Client` system.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information about the API, please refer to the API documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please refer the [terminology document](terminology.md) for a detailed explanation of the terminology used in this document.

### Versioning

The API is versioned. The version is specified in the header of the request. It should not be confused with the version
specified in the `Uri` of the request. This refers to the version of the API itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each endpoint has its own version that should be used and provided in the header of the request.

## Creating a Booking

The API provides an `Endpoint` that allows the `Partner` to create bookings.

### Price strategy

The `Partner` API key is configured by the `Client` on how to handle bookings. The `Client` can choose what strategy
should be
applied if there is a mismatch between the price of the booking being created and the price within the system. The
options are:

* Accept the booking, but with the price from the system
* Deny the booking

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment we don't have a strategy that allows the system to accept the price provided by the `Partner` if it's
> different from the price in the system.

### Example Request and Response

> [!WARNING]
> Use version 3 of our Booking `Endpoint`. Version 1 and 2 is deprecated and will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Rate Limit** Rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse. If you exceed the rate limit you will receive a 429 status.
> Under normal circumstances you should not hit this limit.

**Understanding the `Type` of an `OrderItem`**

* **Option**: When the `OrderItem` has this type, it means that the `Booking` created was a `Probability` or a
  `ProbabilityAsBooking`. It's a forehand booking and the price is not guaranteed. It will later be converted to a
  `Quote` by the `Client` and by then the `Guest` can accept or decline the booking.
* **Quote**: When the `OrderItem` has this type, it means that the `Booking` was created, but no payment has been made
  yet.
* **Invoice**: When the `OrderItem` has this type, it means that the `Booking` was created and full payment or partial
  payment has been made.
